This paper presents a novel two-step methodology for detecting fake images, also focusing on those generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The approach combines the strengths of GANs and traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), resulting in improved accuracy in identifying both fake images and machine-generated fake images. The proposed methodology seems highly promising and serves as a motivation of further research and has significant potential in fields such as media forensics, social media monitoring, and online security.
